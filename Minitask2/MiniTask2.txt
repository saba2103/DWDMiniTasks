1. Complexities faced in the first task.
	I was very scared at first to even start this. I was confused which route to
take. either go through <svg> or canvas. So, i tried svg and got stuck in mid
and then switched to canvas thinking that i can reach the output. again got stuck and
switched back to svg. This kept happening. at last, i decided to go with canvas no matter
what keeping in mind about its versatile use in present day. and finally 
got the output. 

Positioning the canvas and onclick were other two things i struggled a bit at.

One mistake i made was forgetting to read about obtusive and unobtrusive concepts
Which were very important. 


2. What all concepts you learnt?
	I learnt about canvas, div elements, doms, random func, click events
 and most importantly how to use rbg.


3. Experience with your mentor, review and adv task.
	My Web Dev mentor is the best metor i would say. the mentors of all other profiles
that im in, hardly talk to us. they just inform when a task is given and then 
get back to us only on the day before submission. abhi keeps track of every movement 
in the learning process of each one of us. WE GENUINELY are learning a lot in the
right way. I can feel the effort he is putting to teach us every bit which is needed.

My review was so short. only 3 ques were asked.
-canvas
-why web browsers are written in html
-why i used "+x+" for rgb value

i answered the first two. but, i had used the third one blindly in my code without 
knowing what it does just coz abhi had told to use it. something which i shouldn't 
have done. won't repeat it again. will learn first and the n use unknown things.

Advance task was fun. I love such tasks. Pure logic and awesome. 
getting the working main task was exciting and proceeding with
the same excitment made the advance task easy, fun and learning of course.
