1. What is a server?
	a server is a computer program that provides services to other computer 
programs (and their users) in the same or other computers. In the client/server 
programming model, a server is a program that awaits and fulfills requests from 
client programs in the same or other computers. A given application in a computer 
may function as a client with requests for services from other programs and also 
as a server of requests from other programs.

2. What is a localhost?
	localhost is a hostname that means this computer and may be used to access
the computer's own network services via its loopback network interface. Using the 
loopback interface bypasses local network interface hardware.
	
3. What are loopback ip addresses ?
	Loopback address is a special IP number (127.0.0.1) that is designated for 
the software loopback interface of a machine. The loopback interface has no hardware 
associated with it, and it is not physically connected to a network. Loopback ips 
are between 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254.

4. Why loopback ips are between 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254 ?
	All loopbacks are not the same. Sometimes you have multiple services and 
they have to use loopback listening on the same port. You need to assign separate 
loopback addresses if you want to talk to them individually. You can't have one 
loopback address in this case.

5. What is xampp ? what is phpmyadmin ?
	It is intended for use only as a development tool, to allow website designers
and programmers to test their work on their own computers without any access to the 
Internet. To make this as easy as possible, many important security features are 
disabled by default.XAMPP has the ability to serve web pages on the World Wide Web 
although there is no evidence of this being done.
It also provides support for creating and manipulating databases in MySQL and SQLite 
among others.
phpmyadmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL 
with the use of a web browser. It can perform various tasks such as creating, modifying 
or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows; executing SQL statements; or managing 
users and permissions.

6. Why server scripts are not visible in page source?
	Due to security restrictions and it is inherently unsafe to for the sever scripts
to be displayed in page source as the clients will be able to modify and manipulate the
main code and spoil or change the purpose of the page.

7. what is special about www or html or htdocs folders ?
	It is the server root directory where all the files are stored. 

8. explain client-server mechanism.
	
	  i. clients sends a request to server and keeps connections alive;
	 ii. server keeps a handle on the connection and waits;
	iii. when updates are available, server sends back data to client;
	 iv. (depending on client-side tech) client may need to send a new request.
