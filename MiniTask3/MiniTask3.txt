1. What is browser console? Why is that designed?
	a web console logs information associated only with a webpage
whereas a browser console logs information associated with whole browser.
the main purpose of browser consoles is debugging.

2. Write a command in console that changes the source of all the images to this 
"https://goo.gl/P0Xgv7".

	ar images = $$('img');
	for(each in images)
	{
	images[each].src="https://goo.gl/P0Xgv7"; 

3. Research about <kbd>, <marquee>, <blink> tags in HTML and "onerror" event in js.
	
	<kbd> - A HTML Keyboard Input Element that represents user input and produces 
an inline element displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

<marquee> - It is used for scrolling piece of text or image displayed
 either horizontally across or vertically down your web site page depending on the settings.

<blink> - It is a non-standard element causing the enclosed text to flash slowly.

4. What is the advantage and disadvantage of "id" and "class" over each other?

		ID				CLASS

	*ID's are unique		Classes are NOT unique

*Each element can have only one ID	You can use the same class on multiple elements.	

*Each page can have only one element 	Each page can have only one element with that ID
with that ID

*ID's have special browser 		Classes have no special abilities in the browser
functionality				

		*If you don't need them, don't use them
		
			*Elements can have BOTH


5. 	a) alert (' '=='0'); // returns false
	b) alert (0==' '); // returns true
	c) alert (0=='0'); // returns true

 a) ' ' is boolean false and '0' is int 0. so, it returns false.
 b) 0 is boolean false and ' ' is also false. hence, the condition is true.
 c) 0 is boolean false and '0' is also boolean false. hence, the condition is true.

6. What is "return" command in any programming language?

a return command in any programming language returns the desired value from the called
 function to the calling function.

7. Research about functional programming. Relate it with JS.

when we need to write a really really big code, it makes it difficult to locate certain 
codesand look for errors. it looks totally messy. so, in order to keep everything 
properly compiledwe use fuctions where we actually fragment the code into parts and put 
then into functions. whenever we need to execute certain bunch of codes, we just call 
them. we can also pass parametersfunctions.

8. Explain this output in JS.
	var x=5;
	{
		var x=10;
	}
	alert(x); //outputs 10
WHY? Explain how it is different from C/C++?

in js first x is declared as 5. again in the brackets x is redefined as 10 and its 
value is modified.hence it returns 10. 
where as in c/c++, x is initialized to 5. and and then in the brackets a new var 
x is initialized to 10where this x=10 is accessible only inside the brackets. so
 we get an output of 5 i.e the value of x initializedoutside the brackets. if we 
cout x inside the brackets we get 10. and the x=5 is not accessible inside the brackets.

9. If you have already opened some website in your browser, and if you open it nexttime, 
it might load faster than earlier. Why?

when we visit a website is stored offline called cache. so, when we try to open it 
again, it first checks cache. the website exists, it loads the website from cache. 
we also know that our PC is way faster then our internet speed.hence the difference.

10. Draw a ball on a screen and control its movement via arrow keys.

<html>
	<title>Moving Ball</title>
	<style>
		#ball{
			height:100px;
			width:100px;
			border-radius:50px;
			position:absolute;
			top:250px;
			left:550px;
			background-color:black;
		}
	</style>
	<body onkeydown = "move()">
		<div id = "ball"></div>		
	</body>
	<script>
		var ball = document.getElementById('ball');
		var t = ball.offsetTop;
		var l = ball.offsetLeft;
		
		function move(){	
			var keyCode = event.keyCode;
			if (keyCode == '38' && t>0)t-=10;
			else if (keyCode  == '40'&& t<540)t+=10;
			else if (keyCode  == '37' && l>0)l-=10;
			else if (keyCode  == '39'&& l<1260)l+=10;
			ball.style.top=t+'px';
			ball.style.left=l+'px';
		}
	</script>
