simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based 
internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

2. What is browser?
	A browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting and

is identified by a URL and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.

3. How do browsers work?
	The primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources 
to the user, allowing them to view the information, and then access other
information.

4. What is a server?
	Any central device in a workstation network that is capable of accepting 
and passing on information to various nodes can be termed as a server. 

5. How do servers work?
	

6. What is the role of CPU in running browser engines?


7. What is WWW?
	The World Wide Web is an information system of interlinked hypertext 
documents that are accessed via the Internet and built on top of the DNS.

8. What is HTML?
	HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the 
standard markup language used to create web pages.
 
9. WHat is CSS?
	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.

engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces
for many mobile applications.

10. What is Javascript?

scripts in order to interact with user while running an application.

11. What is domain?

administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. 
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the DNS.
Ex - .com, .org, .net, .in, .edu, .gov etc..

12. What is internet?
	The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks 
that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion 
devices worldwide. It is a network of networks[1] that consists of millions of 
private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global
 scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking
 technologies. 

13. What is internet pack?
	A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a 
packet-switched network.

14. What is web?
	

15. What is URL?
	A URL is a URI that, in addition to identifying a web resource, 
specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation, 
specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location.

16. What is URI?
	 It is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource.
It can either be a URL or a URN or both.

17. What happens when you type into a browser's address bar?

#1 browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #9
#2 browser asks OS for server's IP address
#3 OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser
#4 browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)
#5 browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection
#6 browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse 
it for another request
#7 browser checks if the response is a redirect (3xx result status codes), 
authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled 
differently from normal responses (2xx)
#8 if cacheable, response is stored in cache
#9 browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)
#10 browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is 
it an image, is it a sound clip?)
#11 browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types

18. What is WiFi?
	Wi-Fi is a local area wireless computer networking technology
 that allows electronic devices to network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz 
(12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.

19. Why most of the URL starts with http://?
	http tansfers info back and forth between the server and the clients. 
any site with http can communicate with the browser hence anything types 
isn't safe. while https keeps us fully secured.

20. What's https,ftp,ssl,tsl?
	https-hypertext transfer protocol
	ftp- file transfer protocol
	ssl-secure sockets layer
	tsl-transport layer security
